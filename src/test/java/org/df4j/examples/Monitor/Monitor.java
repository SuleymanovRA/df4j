/**
 * Demonstrates how such low-level mechanism as java Monitor
 * (with synchronized/wait/notify operators) can be modelled
 * df4j core classes.
 * Below is a typical flowchart of a synchronized method:
      v--------------------------------------------------------< 
      >-->||                                                   |
process-->||-- (state ok?): no--> / wait();                    |
                   :yes               |>---------------------->|
                     |                                         |
                     v                                         |
                 / change();                                   |
                 / notifyAll();                                |
                 / return;                                     |
                     |                                         |
                     >---------------------------------------->|
 *  MonitorEnter and MonitorExit are modelled with the Actor's fire bit.
 *  We may say all Actor's act() methods are synchronized by construction.
 *  Monitor is just an Actor with main input of type Runnable and 
 *  internal queue to store Runnables which want to wait.
